        <p>How often do you find yourself with bananas gone brown? Here I wanted to use some scotch whiskey paying homage to Bananas Foster cocktail and latte twists, adding a toasted coconut topping to preserve the tropical feel without using rum.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>350-400 g ripe bananas</li>
            <li>100 g salted butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 tsp honey</li>
            <li>3/4 c granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp whiskey</li>
            <li>220 g flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>grated ginger, to taste</li>
            <li>cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Topping:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prep: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Spread 1/4 c dried coconut flakes on a sheet pan to lightly toast, checking frequently.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cream butter and sugar.</li>
            <li>Add wet ingredients. Bananas go last, and are mashed into the mixture; leave chunks to suit your fancy. This will provide pockets of sweetness and a unique texture.</li>
            <li>Combine dry ingredients in a separate, smaller bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix together using the larger of the two bowls, dry goes into wet.</li>
            <li>Pour the combined batter into a greased loaf pan and smooth the top with your mixing instrument.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle your lightly toasted coconut flakes on top of the batter.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a slender instrument inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer and try to resist taking a slice! Your house will smell delicious.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Reference:</h3>
        <p>Bananas Foster was created in the 1950s at Brennan's Restaurant in New Orleans by Chef Paul Blangé. It was named after Richard Foster, a sugar broker, regular customer, and friend of the restaurant's owner. The original dish involves sautéing bananas in butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and rum, then flambéing it. Traditionally, the dessert is served with vanilla ice cream. This banana bread takes inspiration from the classic Bananas Foster flavors by incorporating the rum and caramelized banana notes directly into the bread itself.</p>
        <p>Recently, I've been reflecting on <i>The Year of Living Dangerously</i>, which I like for the cultural mood of the early 1980s—marked by political instability, international conflict, and complex personal narratives that show up in cinema. What I love about the film is its portrayal of an impending crisis or catastrophe, and how this urgency seems almost meaningless for those living on the "veranda" of society—the expats and outsiders who, despite their frantic search for meaning, still have the option to escape when things become too overwhelming.</p>
        <p>In the context of historical events like the arrival of the 24-hour news cycle, and the film’s use of handheld cameras and natural lighting, <i>The Year of Living Dangerously</i> made me think more deeply about Indonesia's trade history and Southeast Asia’s role in spreading bananas and warm spices. It also got me thinking about personal entanglements in systems beyond our control, systems we must navigate with poise, all while folding ourselves into the broader historical narratives.</p>
        <p>In a story I read recently, the drama doesn't stem from easily understood events, but rather from experiences that resist full description. Like <i>The Year of Living Dangerously</i>, it evokes a universality of experience and the urgent need to create meaning from the everyday.</p>
        <p>Since then, I've started reading more about Indonesia and have taken an interest in its cuisine... more to come.</p>
