        <p>How often do you find yourself with bananas gone brown? Here I wanted to use some scotch whiskey paying homage to Bananas Foster cocktail and latte twists, adding a toasted coconut topping to preserve the tropical feel without using rum.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>350-400 g ripe bananas</li>
            <li>100 g salted butter, softened</li>
            <li>2 tsp honey</li>
            <li>3/4 c granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp whiskey</li>
            <li>220 g flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>grated ginger, to taste</li>
            <li>cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For Topping:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Prep: Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F. Spread 1/4 c dried coconut flakes on a sheet pan to lightly toast, checking frequently.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cream butter and sugar.</li>
            <li>Add wet ingredients. Add your bananas last, mashing into the mixture but leaving chunks to suit your fancy. This will provide pockets of sweetness and a unique texture.</li>
            <li>Combine dry ingredients in a separate bowl.</li>
            <li>Mix together using the larger of the two bowls, wet into dry.</li>
            <li>Pour the combined batter into a greased loaf pan and smooth the top with your mixing instrument.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle your lightly toasted coconut flakes on top of the batter.</li>
            <li>Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a slender instrument inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
            <li>Allow the bread to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer and try to resist taking a slice! Your house will smell delicious.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Reference:</h3>
        <p>Bananas Foster was created in the 1950s at Brennan's Restaurant in New Orleans by Chef Paul Blangé. It was named after Richard Foster, a sugar broker, regular, and friend of the restaurant's owner. The original dish involves sautéing bananas in butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and rum, then flambéing it. The dessert is traditionally served with vanilla ice cream. This banana bread takes inspiration from the classic Bananas Foster flavors by adding the rum and caramelized banana notes to the bread itself.</p>
        <p>I have spent much time recently reflecting on the 1983 movie starring Mel Gibson, <i>The Year of Living Dangerously</i>. I found this film in the larger zeitgeist of early 80s themes of political instability, international conflict, and complex personal stories in cinema.</p>
        <p>As a construct in a movie, I love the sense of impending crisis or catastrophe but how even that is futile among those living on the veranda of society—people who, while willingly taking part in the frenetic hypervigilance that feels absurd in its pursuit of reality, are still able to find escape.</p>
        <p>Putting this into the context of the historical events like the arrival of the 24-hour news cycle and shot on-location using handheld cameras and natural lighting, <i>The Year of Living Dangerously</i> encouraged me to think not only about the trade history of Indonesia and broader Southeast Asia that are responsible for the ubiquitous banana and the warm, spiced flavors of comforting quick breads, but also about personal entanglement in systems we cannot control but must navigate with poise, ever folding ourselves into historical narratives.</p>
        <p>The movie has the same quality as a story I read recently, where the drama emerges not from events that are easily understood, but from experiences that elude full description, evoking a universality of experience and the urgent need to construe meaning from the everyday.</p>
