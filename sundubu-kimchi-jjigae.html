        <h2>Recipe</h2>

        <p>I developed this recipe with ChatGPT when hosting my sister for dinner. My other sister was also meant to join but she let us know the following day she'd took hydroxizine and fell asleep at 1930. Anyway, I asked for dinner ideas and said I wanted to use my umami-rich anchovy, kelp, bonito broth purchased from the Asian market.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 c anchovy broth</li>
            <li>1/2 c prepared kimchi</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp gochujaru</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp soya sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>1 clove minced garlic</li>
            <li>1 block tofu, sliced</li>
            <li>1 handful of mung bean noodles</li>
            <li>1 can tuna</li>
            <li>2 green onions</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bloom your garlic and gochujaru in sesame oil, stirring frequently. I used olive oil and added the sesame once the pan was hot and garlic frying.</li>
            <li>Add your kimchi and stir-fry.</li>
            <li>Prepare your anchovy broth and bring to a boil. Add more water as needed to ensure the ingredients are covered. Stir in soya sauce. I added some pepper paste.</li>
            <li>Add drained canned tuna, tofu, and noodles. I like the texture of mung bean noodles. I added winterbor kale because that was the vegetable I had.</li>
            <li>Serve, preferably seated on the ground and eat from the pot using a ladle/spoon/chopstick combination, like hot pot. Garnish with green onions.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Reference:</h3>
        <p>Anchovy broth is a star in my cooking and I love that the whole, dried fish are placed in the packets. I received suggestions for a variety of jjigae and kalguksu dishes when developing this meal. I opted for a combination, which I learned is actually already a Korean dish per Maangchi. I don't have a stone pot but my stock pot works just fine. I am wanting to do a hot pot using the Instant Pot... more details to come.</p>
        <p>Korean food is among my favorites and I love getting food ideas from silent slow living volgs and K-dramas. This year I watched several dramas, which I choose based on the actors and plot lines I reliably like. planD is my favorite vlogger.</p>
